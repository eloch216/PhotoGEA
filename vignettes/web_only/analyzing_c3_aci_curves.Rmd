# Overview

In this vignette, we will give an example showing how to analyze C~3~ _A-C~i~_
data using the `PhotoGEA` package. The commands in this vignette can be used to
initialize your own script, as described in [Customizing Your Script].

# Background

## Understanding C~3~ _A-C~i~_ Curves

An _A-C~i~ curve_ (or _CO~2~ response curve_) is a particular type of gas
exchange measurement where a living leaf is exposed to varying concentrations of
CO~2~. For each CO~2~ concentration in the sequence, the net assimilation rate
($A_n$), stomatal conductance to H~2~O ($g_{sw}$), intercellular CO~2~
concentration ($C_i$), and other important quantities are measured and recorded.
Typically, other environmental variables such as temperature, humidity, and
incident photosynthetically-active photon flux density (PPFD) are held constant
during the measurement sequence so that changes in assimilation rates can be
attributed to CO~2~ alone.

Because of their different cell structures and biochemical pathways, C~3~ and
C~4~ plants have very different responses to CO~2~. Here, we will only be
discussing C~3~ plants.

The full C~3~ photosynthetic pathway is quite complicated, consisting of at
least two hundred individual reactions, each of which may have an impact on a
measured _A-C~i~_ curve. However, simplified models for net CO~2~ assimilation
are available and are much easier to understand and work with. These models tend
to be based around Rubisco kinetics, describing how the net assimilation rate
responds to the amount of CO~2~ available in the chloroplast. The most
widely-used model is typically referred to as the _Farquhar-von-Caemmerer-Berry_
model (often shortened to the _FvCB model_ or _Farquhar model_) after the three
scientists who first published it. An excellent description of this model can be
found in _Biochemical Models of Leaf Photosynthesis_
[@caemmerer_biochemical_2000], subject to a few additional considerations
discussed in @lochocki_widely_2025.

This model provides a framework for understanding the changes in $A_n$ that
occur as a C~3~ leaf is exposed to successively higher concentrations of CO~2~.
Overall, the response to CO~2~ under high light conditions can be divided into
three separate ranges:

- At low levels of CO~2~ in the chloroplast, CO~2~ assimilation is primarily
  limited by Rubisco activity; the maximum rate of Rubisco activity is denoted
  by $V_{cmax}$.

- At intermediate levels of CO~2~ in the chloroplast, CO~2~ assimilation is
  primarily limited by the rate of electron transport going to support RuBP
  regeneration; the potential rate of electron transport at a given incident
  PPFD is denoted by $J$. (Note: $J$ is distinct from the maximum rate of
  electron transport that could be achieved at _any_ incident PPFD, which is
  denoted by $J_{max}$.)

- At high levels of CO~2~ in the chloroplast, CO~2~ assimilation is primarily
  limited by triose phosphate utilization (TPU); the maximum rate of TPU is
  denoted by $T_p$.

More specifically, the model provides equations for potential RuBP carboxylation
rates (as catalyzed by Rubisco) that are each limited by one of three important
processes:

- The Rubisco-limited carboxylation rate ($W_c$).

- The RuBP-regeneration-limited carboxylation rate ($W_j$).

- The triose-phosphate-utilization-limited carboxylation rate ($W_p$).

Each of these rates depend on the CO~2~ concentration in the chloroplast and
other factors such as the incident light intensity. The actual RuBP
carboxylation rate ($V_c$) for a particular set of conditions is taken to be the
smallest of the three potential rates. Then, the net CO~2~ assimilation rate
$A_n$ can be calculated from $V_c$ by including carbon losses due to
photorespiration and non-photorespiratory CO~2~ release; the rate of
non-photorespiratory CO~2~ release in the light is denoted by $R_L$. It is also
possible to calculate the net assimilation rates corresponding to each potential
carboxylation rate: $A_c$, $A_j$, and $A_p$. The plot below illustrates the
three different assimilation ranges observed in a typical high-light _A-C~i~_
curve, as predicted by the FvCB model.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
library(PhotoGEA)
library(lattice)

Tleaf <- 25

cc_max  <- 1000
cc_step <- 1

inputs <- exdf(data.frame(
  Cc = seq(cc_step, cc_max, by = cc_step),
  Tleaf = Tleaf,
  total_pressure = 1,
  oxygen = 21
))

inputs <- document_variables(
  inputs,
  c('', 'Cc',             'micromol mol^(-1)'),

)

xyplot(
  An + Ac + Aj + Ap ~ inputs[, 'Cc'],
  data = assim$main_data,
  type = 'l',
  lwd = c(4, 2, 2, 2),
  lty = c(1, 2, 2, 2),
  auto = TRUE,
  xlab = paste('Chloroplast CO2 concentration [', inputs$units$Cc, ']'),
  ylab = paste('Assimilation rate [', assim$units$An, ']'),
  xlim = c(0, cc_max),
  ylim = c(-5, 60),
  par.settings = list(

    superpose.symbol = list(col = multi_curve_colors())
  ),
  panel = function(x, y, ...) {
    panel.lines(c(0, 0) ~ c(0, cc_max), lty = 2, col = 'black')
    panel.xyplot(x, y, ...)
  }
)
```

(Note: This figure was generated using the `calculate_c3_assimilation` function
from the `PhotoGEA` package, and it represents the photosynethetic response of a
C~3~ leaf according to the FvCB model with
`alpha_old` = `r alpha_old`,
`J` = `r J` `r assim$units$J_tl`, `RL` = `r RL` `r assim$units$RL_tl`,
`Tp` = `r Tp` `r assim$units$Tp`, and
`Vcmax` = `r Vcmax` `r assim$units$Vcmax_tl`. Temperature response parameters
from @sharkey_fitting_2007 were used for these calculations.)

Thus, one of the most common reasons to measure an _A-C~i~_ curve is to
interpret it in the context of this model. In other words, by fitting the
model's equations to a measured curve, it is possible to estimate values for
$J$, $J_{max}$, $R_L$, $T_p$, and $V_{cmax}$. See the documentation for
`calculate_c3_assimilation` for more information about these important
quantities.

## Practicalities

There are a few important practicalities to keep in mind when thinking about
CO~2~ response curves.

One point is that net assimilation models generally predict the response of
assimilation to the CO~2~ concentration in the chloroplast ($C_c$), but gas
exchange measurements can only determine the CO~2~ concentration in the leaf's
intercellular spaces ($C_i$). Thus, an extra step is required when interpreting
_A-C~i~_ curves. If the mesophyll conductance to CO~2~ diffusion ($g_{mc}$) is
known, then it is possible to calculate values of $C_c$ from $A_n$, $C_i$, and
$g_{mc}$. Otherwise, it is typical to assume an infinite mesophyll conductance;
in this case, $C_c = C_i$, and the estimated values of $V_{cmax}$ and other
parameters can be considered to be "effective values" describing the plant's
response to intercellular CO~2~ rather than the true response to chloroplastic
CO~2~.

Another important point is that plants generally do not appreciate being starved
of CO~2~, so it is not usually possible to start a response curve at low CO~2~
and proceed upwards. A more typical approach is to:

1. Begin at ambient atmospheric CO~2~ levels.

2. Decrease towards a low value.

3. Return to ambient levels and wait for the plant to reacclimate; this waiting
   period is usually accomplished by logging several points at ambient CO~2~
   levels.

4. Increase to higher values.

When taking this approach, it therefore becomes necessary to remove the extra
points measured at ambient CO~2~ levels and to reorder the points according to
their CO~2~ values before plotting or analyzing them.

Note: while this approach is commonly used, some reasearchers advocate for
starting either at high or low CO~2~, and continuously decreasing or increasing
the CO~2~ concentration [@sharkey_is_2019].

## The Data

_A-C~i~_ curves are commonly measured using a portable photosynthesis system
such as the Licor Li-6800. These machines record values of $A_n$, $g_{sw}$,
$C_i$, and many other important quantities. They produce two types of output
files: plain-text and Microsoft Excel. It is often more convenient to work with
the Excel files since the entries can be easily modified (for example, to remove
an extraneous row or add a new column). On the other hand, it can be more
difficult to access the file contents using other pieces of software such as R.
However, the `PhotoGEA` package reduces this barrier by including tools for
reading Licor Excel files in R, which will be demonstrated in the following
section.

# Loading Packages

As always, the first step is to load the packages we will be using. In addition
to `PhotoGEA`, we will also use the `lattice` package for generating plots.

```{r setup, eval = FALSE}
# Load required packages
library(PhotoGEA)
library(lattice)
```

If the `lattice` package is not installed on your R setup, you can install it by
typing `install.packages('lattice')`.

# Loading Licor Data

The `PhotoGEA` package includes two files representing _A-C~i~_ curves measured
using two Li-6800 instruments. The data is stored in Microsoft Excel files, and
includes curves measured from two different crop species (tobacco and soybean)
and several different plots of each. Each curve is a sixteen-point CO~2~
response curve; in other words, the CO~2~ concentration in the air surrounding
the leaf was varied, and $A_n$ (among other variables) was measured at each
CO~2~ setpoint. Although these two files are based on real data, noise was added
to it since it is unpublished.

The files will be stored on your computer somewhere in your R package
installation directory, and full paths to these files can be obtained with
`PhotoGEA_example_file_path`:

```{r licor_file_names}
# Define a vector of paths to the files we wish to load; in this case, we are
# loading example files included with the PhotoGEA package
file_paths <- c(
  PhotoGEA_example_file_path('c3_aci_1.xlsx'),
  PhotoGEA_example_file_path('c3_aci_2.xlsx')
)
```

(**Note:** When loading your own files for analysis, it is not advisable to use
`PhotoGEA_example_file_path` as we have done here. Instead, file paths can be
directly written, or files can be chosen using an interactive window. See
[Input Files] below for more information.)

To actually read the data in the files and store them in R objects, we will use
the `read_gasex_file` function from `PhotoGEA`. Since there are multiple files
to read, we will call this function once for each file using `lapply`:

```{r loading_licor_data}
# Load each file, storing the result in a list
licor_exdf_list <- lapply(file_paths, function(fpath) {
  read_gasex_file(fpath, 'time')
})
```

The result from this command is an R list of "extended data frames" (abbreviated
as `exdf` objects). The `exdf` class is a special data structure defined by the
`PhotoGEA` package. In many ways, an `exdf` object is equivalent to a data
frame, with the major difference being that an `exdf` object includes the units
of each column. For more information, type `?exdf` in the R terminal to access
the built-in help menu entry, or check out the
[Working With Extended Data Frames](working_with_extended_data_frames.html)
vignette.

Generally, it is more convenient to work with a single `exdf` object rather than
a list of them, so our next step will be to combine the objects in the list.
This action can be accomplished using the `rbind` function, which combines
table-like objects by their rows; in other words, it stacks two or more tables
vertically. This action only makes sense if the tables have the same columns, so
before we combine the `exdf` objects, we should make sure this is the case.

The `PhotoGEA` package includes a function called `identify_common_columns` that
can be used to get the names of all columns that are present in all of the Licor
files. Then, we can extract just those columns, and then combine the `exdf`
objects into a single one.

```{r combining_licor_data}
# Get the names of all columns that are present in all of the Licor files
columns_to_keep <- do.call(identify_common_columns, licor_exdf_list)

# Extract just these columns
licor_exdf_list <- lapply(licor_exdf_list, function(x) {
  x[ , columns_to_keep, TRUE]
})

# Use `rbind` to combine all the data
licor_data <- do.call(rbind, licor_exdf_list)
```

Now we have a single R object called `licor_data` that includes all the data
from several Licor Excel files. For more information about consolidating
information from multiple files, see the _Common Patterns_ section of the
[Working With Extended Data Frames](working_with_extended_data_frames.html#combining-data-from-several-files)
vignette.

# Validating the Data

Before attempting to fit the curves, it is a good idea to do some basic checks
of the data to ensure it is organized properly and that it was measured
properly.

## Basic Checks

First, we should make sure there is a column in the data whose value uniquely
identifies each curve. In this particular data set, several "user constants"
were defined while making the measurements that help to identify each curve:
`instrument`, `species`, and `plot`. However, neither of these columns alone are
sufficient to uniquely identify each curve. We can solve this issue by creating
a new column that combines the values from each of these:

```{r adding_id_column}
# Create a new identifier column formatted like `instrument - species - plot`
licor_data[ , 'curve_identifier'] <-
  paste(licor_data[ , 'instrument'], '-', licor_data[ , 'species'], '-', licor_data[ , 'plot'])
```

When measuring response curves (or any other type of gas exchange data), it is
strongly recommended to record key pieces of metadata in the log files using
"user constants," as was done in this example. For more information, please see
the [Guide to Licor LI-6800 User Constants](LI6800_user_constants.html), which
also includes advice for dealing with data sets that do not contain such
metadata.

The next step is to make sure that this column correctly identifies each
response curve. To do this, we can use the `check_response_curve_data` function
from `PhotoGEA`. Here we will supply the name of a column that should uniquely
identify each response curve (`curve_identifier`), the expected number of points
in each curve (`16`), the name of a "driving" column that should follow the same
sequence in each curve (`CO2_r_sp`). If the data passes the checks, this
function will have no output and will not produce any messages. (For more
information, see the built-in help menu entry by typing
`?check_response_curve_data`, or visit the
[Frequently Asked Questions](frequent_questions.html).)

```{r check_response_curve}
# Make sure the data meets basic requirements
check_response_curve_data(licor_data, 'curve_identifier', 16, 'CO2_r_sp')
```

However, if `check_response_curve_data` detects an issue, it will print a
helpful message to the R terminal. For example, if we had specified the wrong
number of points or the wrong identifier column, we would get error messages:

```{r check_response_curve_error, error = TRUE}
check_response_curve_data(licor_data, 'curve_identifier', 15)

check_response_curve_data(licor_data, 'species', 16)
```

## Reorganizing the Data

As discussed in [Practicalities], there are several repeated points logged at
the same CO~2~ concentration, and the points are not logged in order of
ascending or descending concentration. In fact, the sequence of CO~2~ setpoints
is as follows:

```{r}
licor_data[licor_data[, 'curve_identifier'] == 'ripe2 - soybean - 1', 'CO2_r_sp']
```

The extra recovery points should not be used when plotting or fitting the
curves. Additionally, any plots may look strange if the points are not ordered
by their `Ci` values.

So, we would like to remove the ninth and tenth points (where the setpoint
has been reset to 400 to allow the leaf to reacclimate to ambient CO~2~ levels),
and reorder the data so it is arranged from low to high values of `Ci`. This can
be done using the `organize_response_curve` function from `PhotoGEA`:

```{r reorganizing_curves}
# Remove points with duplicated `CO2_r_sp` values, reorder by `Ci`, and
# calculate average values of leaf temperature and Qin
licor_data <- organize_response_curve_data(
    licor_data,
    'curve_identifier',
    c(9, 10),
    'Ci',
    columns_to_average = c('TleafCnd', 'Qin')
)
```

In this command, we also used the optional `columns_to_average` input argument
to calculate average values of leaf temperature and incident PPFD for each
curve, which are attached as new columns called `TleafCnd_avg` and `Qin_avg`,
respectively. These will be important later for calculating values of $J_{max}$.

## Plotting the _A-C~i~_ Curves

One qualitative way to check the data is to simply create a plot of the _A-C~i~_
curves. In this situation, the `lattice` library makes it simple to include each
curve as its own separate subplot of a figure. For example:

```{r plot_aci}
# Plot all A-Ci curves in the data set
xyplot(
  A ~ Ci | curve_identifier,
  data = licor_data$main_data,
  type = 'b',
  pch = 16,
  auto = TRUE,
  grid = TRUE,
  xlab = paste('Intercellular CO2 concentration [', licor_data$units$Ci, ']'),
  ylab = paste('Net CO2 assimilation rate [', licor_data$units$A, ']')
)
```

Some of these curves look a bit strange, but this is related to the noise that
was intentionally added to the data. Three curves exhibit a sharp and likely
unrealistic downturn in assimilation at their highest values of $C_i$. These
will pose a problem for fitting, and we will remove them later after making some
other quality checks.

## Additional Plots for Qualitative Validation

Sometimes a Licor will override the temperature or humidity controls while
making measurements; in this case, conditions inside the measurement chamber may
not be stable, and we may wish to exclude some of these points. We can check for
these types of issues by making more plots. In the following sections, we will
generate several different plots to check each curve for quality.

### Humidity Control

```{r plot_humidity}
# Make a plot to check humidity control
xyplot(
  RHcham + `Humidifier_%` + `Desiccant_%` ~ Ci | curve_identifier,
  data = licor_data$main_data,
  type = 'b',
  pch = 16,
  auto = TRUE,
  grid = TRUE,
  ylim = c(0, 100),
  xlab = paste('Intercellular CO2 concentration [', licor_data$units$Ci, ']')
)
```

Here, `Humidifier_%` and `Desiccant_%` represent the flow from the humidifier
and desiccant columns, where a value of 0 indicates that the valve to the column
is fully closed and a value of 100 indicates that the valve to the column is
fully opened. `RHcham` represents the relative humidity inside the chamber as a
percentage (in other words, as a value between 0 and 100).

When these curves were measured, a chamber humidity setpoint was specified. So,
when looking at this plot, we should check that the relative humidity is fairly
constant during each curve. Typically, this should be accompanied by relatively
smooth changes in the valve percentages as they accomodate changes in ambient
humidity and leaf photosynthesis. In this plot, all the data looks good.

### Temperature Control

```{r plot_temperature}
# Make a plot to check temperature control
xyplot(
  TleafCnd + Txchg ~ Ci | curve_identifier,
  data = licor_data$main_data,
  type = 'b',
  pch = 16,
  auto = TRUE,
  grid = TRUE,
  ylim = c(25, 40),
  xlab = paste('Intercellular CO2 concentration [', licor_data$units$Ci, ']'),
  ylab = paste0('Temperature (', licor_data$units$TleafCnd, ')')
)
```

Here, `TleafCnd` is the leaf temperature measured using a thermocouple, and
`Txchg` is the temperature of the heat exhanger that is used to control the air
temperature in the measurement instrument. When these curves were measured, an
exchanger setpoint was specified. So, when looking at this plot, we should check
that `Txchg` is constant during each curve and that the leaf temperature does
not vary in an erratic way. In this plot, all the data looks good.

### CO~2~ Control

```{r plot_co2}
# Make a plot to check CO2 control
xyplot(
  CO2_s + CO2_r + CO2_r_sp ~ Ci | curve_identifier,
  data = licor_data$main_data,
  type = 'b',
  pch = 16,
  auto = TRUE,
  grid = TRUE,
  xlab = paste('Intercellular CO2 concentration [', licor_data$units$Ci, ']'),
  ylab = paste0('CO2 concentration (', licor_data$units$CO2_r, ')')
)
```

Here, `CO2_s` is the CO~2~ concentration in the sample cell, `CO2_r` is the
CO~2~ concentration in the reference cell, and `CO2_r_sp` is the setpoint for
`CO2_r`. When these curves were measured, a sequence of `CO2_r` values was
specified, so, when looking at this plot, we should check that `CO2_r` is
close to `CO2_r_sp`. We also expect that `CO2_s` should be a bit lower than
`CO2_r` because the leaf in the sample chamber is assimilating CO~2~, which
should reduce its concentration in the surrounding air. (An exception to this
rule occurs at very low values of `CO2_r_sp`, where the leaf actually releases
CO~2~.) In this plot, all the data looks good.

### Stability

```{r plot_stability}
# Make a plot to check stability criteria
xyplot(
  `A:OK` + `gsw:OK` + Stable ~ Ci | curve_identifier,
  data = licor_data$main_data,
  type = 'b',
  pch = 16,
  auto = TRUE,
  grid = TRUE,
  xlab = paste('Intercellular CO2 concentration [', licor_data$units$Ci, ']')
)
```

When measuring response curves with a Licor, it is possible to specify stability
criteria for each point in addition to minimum and maximum wait times. In other
words, once the set point for the driving variable is changed, the machine waits
until the stability criteria are met; there is a minimum waiting period, and
also a maximum to prevent the machine from waiting for too long.

When these curves were measured, stability criteria were supplied for the net
assimilation rate `A` and the stomatal conductance `gsw`. The stability status
for each was stored in the log file because the appropriate logging option for
stability was set. Now, for each point, it is possible to check whether
stability was achieved or whether the point was logged because the maximum
waiting period had been met. If the maximum waiting period is reached and the
plant has still not stabilized, the data point may be unreliable, so it can be
helpful to check this information.

In the plot, `A:OK` indicates whether `A` was stable (0 for no, 1 for yes),
`gsw:OK` indicates whether `gsw` was stable (0 for no, 1 for yes), and
`Stable` indicates the total number of stability conditions that were met. So,
we are looking for points where `Stable` is 2. Otherwise, we can check the other
traces to see whether `A` or `gsw` was unstable.

Comparing these plots with the ones in [Plotting the _A-C~i~_ Curves], it seems
that the unstable points correspond with some of the "odd-looking" points in the
_A-C~i~_ curves, so it is probably a good idea to remove them before fitting the
data.

## Cleaning the Licor Data

While checking over the plots in the previous sections, two issues were noticed:
(1) some points were logged before stability was achieved and (2) some curves
have strange points at high $C_i$. In this section, we will demonstrate how to
remove the unstable and unusual points.

The following command will keep only the points where `Stable` is exactly 2;
this condition means that all of the stability criteria were satisfied.
Sometimes, following this procedure, a curve will have very few stable points
remaining; it is usually a good idea to automatically exclude any curve with
fewer than three stable points.

```{r remove_unstable_points}
# Only keep points where stability was achieved
licor_data <- licor_data[licor_data[, 'Stable'] == 2, , TRUE]

# Remove any curves that have fewer than three remaining points
npts <- by(licor_data, licor_data[, 'curve_identifier'], nrow)
ids_to_keep <- names(npts[npts > 2])
licor_data <- licor_data[licor_data[, 'curve_identifier'] %in% ids_to_keep, , TRUE]
```

Next, we can use the `remove_points` function from `PhotoGEA` to exclude the
points where there is a decrease in $A$ at high $C_i$. It just so happens that
all of these points were measured by the `ripe1` instrument and occur at the
highest CO~2~ setpoint value, so it is easy to specify them all at once:

```{r remove_points}
# Remove points where `instrument` is `ripe1` and `CO2_r_sp` is 1800
licor_data <- remove_points(
  licor_data,
  list(instrument = 'ripe1', CO2_r_sp = 1800),
  method = 'exclude'
)
```

# Fitting Licor Data

Now that we have checked the data quality, we are ready to perform the fitting.
In order to fit the curves, there are several required pieces of information
that are not included in the Licor data files as produced by the instrument:
values of the total pressure and temperature-dependent values of important
photosynthetic parameters such as $\Gamma^*$. However, the `PhotoGEA` package
includes two functions to help with these calculations:
`calculate_temperature_response` and `calculate_total_pressure`. Each of these
requires an `exdf` object containing Licor data. The units for each required
column will be checked in an attempt to avoid unit-related errors. More
information about these functions can be obtained from the built-in help system
by typing `?calculate_total_pressure` or `?calculate_total_pressure`.

First, we can use `calculate_temperature_response`:

```{r calculate_t_response}
# Calculate temperature-dependent values of C3 photosynthetic parameters
licor_data <- calculate_temperature_response(licor_data, c3_temperature_param_sharkey)
```

With this simple command, we have used the leaf temperature from the Licor
file to calculate values of several key C~3~ photosynthetic parameters
(`r paste(names(c3_temperature_param_sharkey), collapse = ', ')`) according to
the temperature response parameters specified in @sharkey_fitting_2007.

Now we can use `calculate_total_pressure`:

```{r calculate_pressure}
# Calculate the total pressure in the Licor chamber
licor_data <- calculate_total_pressure(licor_data)
```

Together, these functions add several new columns to `licor_data`, including
`total_pressure`, `Gamma_star`, and others. With this information, we are now
ready to perform the fitting procedure.

For this operation, we can use the `fit_c3_aci` function from the `PhotoGEA`
package, which fits a single response curve to extract the values of key
photosynthetic parameters. To apply this function to each curve in a larger data
set and then consolidate the results, we can use it in conjunction with `by` and
`consolidate`, which are also part of `PhotoGEA`. (For more information about
these functions, see the built-in help menu entries by typing `?fit_c3_aci`,
`?by.exdf`, or `?consolidate`, or check out the _Common Patterns_ section of the
[Working With Extended Data Frames](working_with_extended_data_frames.html#processing-multiple-pieces-of-an-extended-data-frame)
vignette.) Together, these functions will split apart the main data using
the curve identifier column we defined before ([Basic Checks]), fit each _A-C~i~_
curve using the FvCB model discussed in [Understanding C~3~ _A-C~i~_ Curves], and
return the resulting parameters and fits:

```{r fit_c3_aci}
# The default optimizer uses randomness, so we will set a seed to ensure the
# results from this fit are always identical
set.seed(1234)

# Fit the C3 A-Ci curves
c3_aci_results <- consolidate(by(
  licor_data,                       # The `exdf` object containing the curves
  licor_data[, 'curve_identifier'], # A factor used to split `licor_data` into chunks
  fit_c3_aci,                       # The function to apply to each chunk of `licor_data`
  Ca_atmospheric = 420              # Additional argument passed to `fit_c3_aci`
))
```

Note that in this command, we used the default fitting settings. In this case,
we will vary all five key photosynthetic parameters: $\alpha_{old}$, $J$, $R_L$,
$T_p$, and $V_{cmax}$. The mesophyll conductance ($g_{mc}$) is set to infinity
by default, so these fits are made assuming $C_c = C_i$, and hence the estimates
of $V_{cmax}$ and other parameters should be considered as "effective" values
rather than chloroplastic values.

## Viewing the Fitted Curves

Having made the fits, it is now a good idea to visually check them, making sure
they look reasonable. This can be done using a built-in plotting function called
`plot_c3_aci_fit`. In addition to the fitted values of `An`, the output also
includes values of the potential limiting rates `Ac`, `Aj`, and `Ap`, as well as
the estimated operating point.

```{r plot_fits}
# Plot the C3 A-Cc fits (including limiting rates)
plot_c3_aci_fit(c3_aci_results, 'curve_identifier', 'Ci', ylim = c(-10, 80))
```

In general, these fits look good. There are a few specific things to notice:

- The fitted values of `An` closely match the measured ones. This is a good
  sign.

- Each curve begins with a Rubisco-limited portion (where `An = Ac`). This is
  expected for light-saturated _A-C~i~_ curves.

- Some curves do not have values of `Aj`. This means that no points were
  identified as being limited by RuBP regeneration. It is not possible to
  estimate values of `J` from such curves.

- Some curves do not have values of `Ap`. This means that no points were
  identified as being limited by TPU. It is not possible to
  estimate values of `Tp` from such curves.

- One curve is almost entirely limited by Rubisco activity. Based on its values
  of `Ci`, it seems that this plant's stomata did not fully open during the
  measurement, almost fully restricting the measured assimilation values to the
  Rubisco-limited range. For this curve, the optimizer identified just one point
  as being RuBP-regeneration-limited, so the associated value of `J` may not be
  reliable.

It is typical that some parameters cannot be estimated from some _A-C~i~_
curves. This is an unavoidable consquence of the inherent variability between
plant leaves.

Checking the residuals is also a powerful way to gauge the quality of a fit. The
output from `fit_c3_aci` includes the residuals (calculated as `A - A_fit`) in
its output, so it is easy to plot them:

```{r plot_residuals}
# Plot the residuals
xyplot(
  A_residuals ~ Ci | curve_identifier,
  data = c3_aci_results$fits$main_data,
  type = 'b',
  pch = 16,
  grid = TRUE,
  xlab = paste0('Intercellular CO2 concentration (', c3_aci_results$fits$units$Ci, ')'),
  ylab = paste0('Assimilation rate residual (measured - fitted)\n(', c3_aci_results$fits$units$A, ')')
)
```

A good fit should produce small and randomly-distributed residuals; here there
is no clear pattern to the residuals, so this model is able to reproduce the
measured values well.

## Calculating Jmax

The `fit_c3_aci` function estimates values of $J$, but not $J_{max}$. However,
estimates of $J_{max}$ can be obtained after fitting by applying the
`calculate_jmax` function to the results from `fit_c3_aci`. For more information
about this function, see the built-in help menu entry by typing
`?calculate_jmax`.

In order to do this, we need values of $Q_{in}$ and $T_{leaf}$ for each curve.
This information is not typically included in a Licor file, but we calculated
average values of $Q_{in}$ and $T_{leaf}$ in the [Reorganizing the Data] section
when calling `organize_response_curve_data`, so this is taken care of.

It is also necessary to have temperature-dependent values of $\alpha_J$ and
$\theta_J$, two parameters related to $J$ and $J_{max}$. These can be obtained
using the `calculate_temperature_response` function, which was also used in the
[Fitting Licor Data] section above.

```{r calculate_jmax}
# Calculate temperature-dependent values of Jmax-related parameters
c3_aci_results$parameters <- calculate_temperature_response(
    c3_aci_results$parameters,
    jmax_temperature_param_bernacchi,
    'TleafCnd_avg'
)

# Calculate Jmax
c3_aci_results$parameters <- calculate_jmax(c3_aci_results$parameters)
```

With these commands, the `parameters` element of `c3_aci_results` now includes
estimates of $J_{max}$.

Be aware that estimates of $J_{max}$ are dependent on the assumed values of
$\alpha_J$ and $\theta_J$ at 25 degrees C, especially for curves measured at low
values of incident PPFD; see the documentation for `calculate_jmax` for more
information.

# Examining the Results

## Accessing Best-Fit Estimates and Confidence Intervals

Each fit returns best-fit values and confidence limits for each parameter, which
are stored in `c3_aci_results$parameters`, another `exdf` object. For example,
we can look at the estimated $J$ values from each curve as follows:

```{r view_j_lim}
# View values of J from each fit
c3_aci_results$parameters[, c('curve_identifier', 'J_at_25_lower', 'J_at_25', 'J_at_25_upper')]
```

Here we can see that some curves have an upper limit of infinity (`Inf`) and a
best-fit value of "not available" (`NA`). Comparing this table to the figure
showing the fits, we can see that these are the curves where one or fewer points
are limited by RuBP regeneration. For these curves, values of `J` cannot be
reliably estimated, so `fit_c3_aci` returns a value of `NA` for `J_at_25`.

Because the values of $J_{max}$ are calculated from the $J$ estimates,
`Jmax_at_25` will also be `NA` whenever `J_at_25` is NA:

```{r view_jmax_lim}
# View values of Jmax from each fit
c3_aci_results$parameters[, c('curve_identifier', 'Jmax_at_25_lower', 'Jmax_at_25', 'Jmax_at_25_upper')]
```

In contrast, each curve has an associated value of $V_{cmax}$ with a finite
confidence interval:

```{r view_vcmax_lim}
# View values of Vcmax from each fit
c3_aci_results$parameters[, c('curve_identifier', 'Vcmax_at_25_lower', 'Vcmax_at_25', 'Vcmax_at_25_upper')]
```

## Visualizing Average Best-Fit Parameters

We can also visualize the best-fit parameters using plots. One way to do this is
by using the `barchart_with_errorbars` function from `PhotoGEA` to create
barcharts of the average values for each species. This function will ignore any
`NA` values from curves where a parameter could not be reliably estimated, and
the error bars will show the standard error of the mean for each species.

```{r vcmax_barchart}
# Make a barchart showing average Vcmax values
barchart_with_errorbars(
  c3_aci_results$parameters[, 'Vcmax_at_25'],
  c3_aci_results$parameters[, 'species'],
  ylim = c(0, 180),
  xlab = 'Species',
  ylab = paste0('Vcmax at 25 degrees C (', c3_aci_results$parameters$units$Vcmax_at_25, ')')
)
```

Another option is to create box-whisper plots using the `bwplot` function from
the `lattice` package:

```{r vcmax_bwplot}
# Make a boxplot showing the distribution of Vcmax values
bwplot(
  Vcmax_at_25 ~ species,
  data = c3_aci_results$parameters$main_data,
  ylim = c(0, 180),
  xlab = 'Species',
  ylab = paste0('Vcmax at 25 degrees C (', c3_aci_results$parameters$units$Vcmax_at_25, ')')
)
```

## Calculating Average Best-Fit Parameters

We can also calculate average values and standard errors of the best-fit
parameters for each species using the `basic_stats` function from `PhotoGEA`:

```{r calculate_stats}
# Compute the average and standard error of each parameter for each species
c3_aci_averages <- basic_stats(c3_aci_results$parameters, 'species')

# View the averages and errors
columns_to_view <- c(
  'species',
  'Vcmax_at_25_avg', 'Vcmax_at_25_stderr',
  'J_at_25_avg', 'J_at_25_stderr',
  'RL_at_25_avg', 'RL_at_25_stderr',
  'Tp_at_25_avg', 'Tp_at_25_stderr'
)

c3_aci_averages[ , columns_to_view]
```

## Other Ideas for Synthesizing Results

Statistical tests to check for differences between groups can be performed
within R using other packages such as `onewaytests` or `DescTools`.
Alternatively, the parameter values can be exported to a comma-separated-value
(CSV) file and analyzed in another software environment like `jmp`.

# Customizing Your Script

Note that most of the commands in this vignette have been written in a general
way so they can be used as the basis for your own analysis script (see
[Commands From This Document]). In order to use them in your own script, some or
all of the following changes may be required. There may also be others not
specifically mentioned here.

## Input Files

The file paths specified in `file_paths` will need to be modified so they point
to your Licor files. One way to do this in your own script is to simply write
out relative or absolute paths to the files you wish to load. For example, you
could replace the previous definition of `file_paths` with this one:

```{r write_file_paths, eval = FALSE}
# Define a vector of paths to the files we wish to load
file_paths <- c(
  'myfile1.xlsx',        # `myfile1.xlsx` must be in the current working directory
  'C:/documents/myfile2' # This is an absolute path to `myfile2`
)
```

You may also want to consider using the `choose_input_licor_files` function from
`PhotoGEA`; this function will create a pop-up browser window where you can
interactively select a set of files. Sometimes this is more convenient than
writing out file paths or names. For example, you could replace the previous
definition of `file_paths` with this one:

```{r choose_licor_files, eval = FALSE}
# Interactively define a vector of paths to the files we wish to load
file_paths <- choose_input_licor_files()
```

Unfortunately, `choose_input_licor_files` is only available in interactive R
sessions running on Microsoft Windows, but there is also a platform-independent
option: `choose_input_files`. See the _Translation_ section of the
[Developing a Data Analysis Pipeline](developing_a_data_analysis_pipeline.html#translation)
vignette for more details.

## Curve Identifier

Depending on which user constants are defined in your Licor Excel files, you may
need to modify the definition of the `curve_identifier` column.

## Data Cleaning

Depending on the qualitative data checks, you may need to change the input
arguments to `remove_points`. It might also not be necessary to remove the
unstable points before performing the fits. Often, it is helpful to not perform
any data cleaning at first, and then remove problematic points if they seem to
cause problems with the fits.

## Plots

You may need to change the axis limits in some or all of the plots.
Alternatively, you can remove them, allowing `xyplot` to automatically choose
them for you.

You may also want to consider using the `pdf_print` function from `PhotoGEA` to
save some or all of your plots as PDFs. See the help page for more info:
`?pdf_print`.

## Saving Results

You may want to use `write.csv.exdf` to save some or all of the fitting results
as CSV files. When writing the contents of an `exdf` object to a CSV file,
using `write.csv.exdf` rather than `write.csv` will ensure that units are
included with each column.

For example, the following commands will allow you to interactively
choose output filenames for the resulting CSV files:

```{r saving_csv_files, eval = FALSE}
write.csv.exdf(c3_aci_results$fits, file.choose())
write.csv.exdf(c3_aci_results$parameters, file.choose())
write.csv.exdf(c3_aci_averages, file.choose())
```
