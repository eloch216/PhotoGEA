# WARNING: The .Rbuildignore syntax has no way to indicate a comment, so all the
# lines in this file that begin with `#` are actually commands to exclude files
# with peculiar names that include substrings like `# subdirectories.`. For this
# reason, there should not be any blank comment lines, because they would
# exclude any files with `#` in the filename, possibly causing confusing issues.
