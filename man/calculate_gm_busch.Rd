\title{Calculate mesophyll conductance to CO2 diffusion}

\description{
  Calculates mesophyll conductance to CO2 diffusion (\code{gmc}) from combined
  gas exchange and isotope discrimination measurements as described in Busch
  et al. (2020). This function can accomodate alternative colum names for the
  variables taken from \code{exdf_obj}; it also checks the units of each
  required column and will produce an error if any units are incorrect.

\details{
  This function uses a model for photosynthetic discrimination against 13C in
  C3 plants to determine mesophyll conductance values as described in Busch et
  al. (2020). That paper provides two alternate ways to calculate \code{e_star},
  and two alternate ways to calculate mesophyll conductance \code{gmc}; this
  function allows the user to choose between them. In more detail:

  \itemize{
    \item Isotopic fractionation due to day respiration
          (\code{e_prime = e + e_star}) is calculated with \code{e_star} given
          by either Equation 19 or 20 depending on the value of
          \code{e_star_equation}.
    \item Isotopic discrimination assuming infinite mesophyll conductance
          (\code{Delta_i}) is calculated by setting \code{Cc = Ci} in either
          Equation 2 or 13, depending on the value of \code{gm_type}.
    \item Mesophyll conductance to CO2 (\code{gmc}) is calculated using either
          Equation 21 or 22, depending on the value of \code{gm_type}.
  }

  Note 1: Setting \code{e_star_equation = 19} and \code{gm_type = 'con'} should
  produce identical or similar results to \code{\link{calculate_gm_ubierna}}.

  Note 2: Using \code{e_star_equation = 20} and \code{gm_type = 'dis'} is
  expected to be more accurate, as discussed in Busch et al. (2020); however, be
  aware that this method requires a value for \code{Delta_obs_growth}, which may
  not always be available unless it is intentionally measured.

\value{
  An \code{exdf} object based on \code{exdf_obj} that includes the following
  additional columns, calculated as described above: \code{e_prime},
  \code{e_star}, \code{Delta_i}, and \code{gmc}, as well as the values of a few
  intermediate calculations such as \code{Delta_i_term_1} and
  \code{Delta_i_term_2}. The category for each of these new columns is
  \code{calculate_gm_busch} to indicate that they were created using this
  function.
