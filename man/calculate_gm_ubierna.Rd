\title{Calculate mesophyll conductance to CO2 diffusion}

\description{
  Calculates mesophyll conductance to CO2 diffusion (\code{gmc}) from combined
  gas exchange and isotope discrimination measurements as described in Ubierna
  et al. (2018). This function can accomodate alternative colum names for the
  variables taken from \code{exdf_obj}; it also checks the units of each
  required column and will produce an error if any units are incorrect.

\details{
  This function uses the comprehensive model for photosynthetic discrimination
  against 13C in C3 plants to calculate mesophyll conductance, as described in
  Ubierna et al. (2018). In particular, the following equations from that source
  are implemented in the code:

  \itemize{
    \item Isotopic fractionation due to day respiration (\code{e_prime}) is
          calculated using Equations 28 and 30.
    \item Isotopic discrimination due to photorespiration (\code{Delta_f}), due
          to day respiration (\code{Delta_e}), and that would occur if Ci = Cc
          in the absence of any respiratory fractionation (\code{Delta_i}) are
          calculated using Equations 34, 33, and 31, respectively.
    \item Mesophyll conductance to CO2 diffusion (\code{gmc}) is calculated
          using Equation 44. This equation is broken up into two factors called
          \code{Delta_difference} and \code{equation_top} which are separately
          returned in the output from \code{calculate_gm_ubierna}.
  }
