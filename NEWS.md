<!--
This file should document all significant changes brought about by each new
release.

All changes related to a particular release should be collected under a heading
specifying the version number of that release, such as
"## Changes in PhotoGEA version 2.0.0". The individual changes should be listed
as bullet points and categorized under "### Major changes", "### Minor changes",
or "### Bug fixes" following the major.minor.patch structure of semantic
versioning.

To facilitate this, when a feature on a feature branch is completed and a pull
request is being prepared, a new section should be added at the top of this file
under the heading "## Unreleased"; it should list all the important changes made
on the feature branch.

Then, when it comes time to merge the feature branch into `unreleased`, the new
"## Unreleased" section is transferred into the `unreleased` branch's version of
NEWS.md, or, if the `unreleased` branch already has an "## Unreleased" section
in its version of NEWS.md, the feature branch's "## UNRELEASED" section will be
integrated into the one on the `unreleased` branch. (This process of integrating
the two "## UNRELEASED" sections will likely be part of resolving an inevitable
merge conflict.)

Finally, when a new release is made, "## Unreleased" should be replaced by a
heading with the new version number, such as
"## Changes in PhotoGEA version 2.0.0". This section will combine the draft
release notes for all features that have been added since the previous release.

In the case of a hotfix, a short section headed by the new release number should
be directly added to this file to describe the related changes.

## Changes in PhotoGEA version 1.3.2 (2024-04-08)

This is the first version of PhotoGEA available on CRAN.

### Minor user-facing changes

- Made sure all exported functions have `value` and `examples` sections in their
  documentation.
- Specify `tz = 'America/Chicago'` when pairing TDL and gas exchange data, since
  setting `tz = 'US/Central'` does not seem to work on debian. CRAN checks the
  package examples on debian.
- Added `read_cr3000`, `read_licor_6800_Excel`, and `read_licor_6800_plaintext`
  so they can be used in examples without needing `:::`.

### Internal changes

- Designated most vignettes as "web only" to make the package smaller; this is
  important for complying with CRAN guidelines.
- Set `maxiter` to 40 when using `stats::uniroot` to calculate confidence
  intervals; this saves quite a bit of time compared to the default value (1000)
  and prevents several examples from being flagged by `R CMD check` for taking
  too long to run.
- Use `message` to send messages to the user in `rbind.exdf` rather than `cat`
  or `print`. This is necessary to comply with CRAN requirements.

### Bug fixes

- Fixed an error that occurred when removing unreliable C4 parameter estimates
  without first calculating confidence intervals.

## Changes in PhotoGEA version 1.3.0 (2024-04-04)

### Minor user-facing changes

- Separated the temperature response of `Gamma_star` from its value at 25
  degrees C. With this change, several functions (including `fit_c3_aci` and
  `fit_c3_variable_j`) now have separate inputs for `Gamma_star_at_25` and
  `Gamma_star_norm`. The fitting functions can now fit `Gamma_star_at_25` rather
  than `Gamma_star`, which previously represented the value at leaf temperature.
  Since each set of temperature response parameters (such as
  `c3_temperature_param_bernacchi`) tends to use a different value of
  `Gamma_star_at_25`, the temperature response parameter lists now include both
  `Gamma_star_at_25` and `Gamma_star_norm`.
- Separated the temperature responses of `Kc` and `Ko` from their values at 25
  degrees C, and enabled fits of `Kc_at_25` and `Ko_at_25`. As with
  `Gamma_star`, the temperature response parameter lists include values at 25
  degrees C and the normalized temperature responses.
- Added values of `alpha_j_at_25` and `theta_j_at_25` to the Jmax-related
  temperature response parameter lists.
- The `calculate_gamma_star` function now returns values of `Gamma_star_tl` to
  more clearly indicate that the values are specified at leaf temperature.
- The `organize_response_curve_data` function now only calls
  `check_response_curve_data` when points are being removed, making it more
  flexible.
- Added two new vignettes: one is for frequently asked questions
  (`frequent_questions.Rmd`), and the other is a gallery of PhotoGEA
  publications (`publications.Rmd`). Along with this change, the `pkgdown` web
  site was reorganized to put the PhotoGEA publications in their own tab on the
  main navigation bar.
- Removed curvature parameters from `calculate_c3_assimilation`. Allowing
  co-limitation is a complication for fitting, and tends to produce unreasonable
  results, so it doesn't make sense to allow it.
- Renamed `atp_use` and `nadph_use` to `Wj_coef_C` and `Wj_coef_Gamma_star`
  because the old names and definitions for these parameters were not accurate.
- Included references to the PhotoGEA paper in several places, such as
  `DESCRIPTION` and `README.md`.

### Bug fixes

- The carboxylation rate (`Vc`) and net assimilation rate (`An`) are now
  consistent when using the min-A variant of the FvCB model.

## Changes in PhotoGEA version 1.2.0 (2025-03-12)

### Minor user-facing changes

- Added a vignette with advice for Licor LI-6800 user constants.
- Added a new function for calculating values of Jmax (`calculate_jmax`) and
  included it in the C3 and C4 A-Ci curve vignettes. Along with this function,
  new temperature response parameters were added:
  `jmax_temperature_param_bernacchi` and `jmax_temperature_param_flat`. These
  employ polynomial temperature responses, a new type that was also added to the
  package via the `calculate_temperature_response_polynomial` function.
- `identify_c3_limiting_processes` now returns each co-limiting process when
  assimilation is co-limited.
- Several functions were modified to accept `data.frame` objects in addition to
  `exdf` objects: `calculate_ball_berry_index`, `calculate_c3_assimilation`,
  `calculate_residuals`, `document_variables`, `identify_c3_limiting_processes`,
  and `set_variable`.
- Added functionality for reading user remarks to `read_licor_6800_plaintext`
  and `read_licor_6800_Excel`.
- Added a new input argument to `organize_response_curve_data` that enables
  calculations of average values for specified columns.
- Improved `exdf` construction and element access; now it is possible to provide
  just a few units when creating an `exdf` object, and it is possible to create
  single-column `exdf` objects.
- When calling `print` or `str` on an `exdf` object, the text printed to the
  terminal now explains that it was generated by converting an `exdf` to a
  `data.frame`.
- Licor LI-6800 Excel log files must now have a sheet called `Measurements`. A
  `Remarks` sheet is optional.
- `factorize_id_column` can now work with other control group names besides
  `WT`.

### Bug fixes

- A bug was fixed where `Gamma_star` was sometimes accidentally removed from the
  outputs of `fit_c3_aci` and `fit_c3_variable_j`
- Optional input arguments to `calculate_c3_assimilation` are checked to make
  sure they are supported. Going forward, any new functions with optional
  arguments (such as `calculate_jmax`) will use this same check.
- Removed `Qin` from several functions related to C4 A-Ci curves, since `Qin` is
  not actually needed for fitting C4 A-Ci curves.

### Internal changes

- The `unit_dictionary` is now a function rather than a list, which enables
  better error messages when a quantity is not included in the dictionary; a few
  mistakes were discovered this way (and fixed).

## Changes in PhotoGEA version 1.1.0 (2024-12-09)

- The parameter trust values have been changed from logical values (`TRUE` or
  `FALSE`) to a numeric indicator (0, 1, or 2). These values indicate severe
  unreliability, potential unreliability, and full reliability, respectively.
- Added several optional input arguments to `calculate_c3_assimilation` that
  allow variants of the FvCB model to be used: `use_min_A`, `TPU_threshold`,
  `use_FRL`, and `consider_depletion`. These can also be specified when fitting
  curves.
- The behavior of `identify_c3_unreliable_pts` was modified to make it
  compatible with the new `use_min_A` option.
- A new option was added to `remove_points`, allowing users to exclude points
  from any subsequent fits rather than completely removing them.
  - `plot_c3_aci_fit` and the other fit plotting functions have been altered to
    distinguish between points included in or excluded from the fit.
  - `xyplot_avg_rc` has been altered to exclude such points when calculating
    average values
- Outliers can now be excluded automatically when creating a barchart using
  `barchart_with_errorbars`
- More information is now included in the output from `fit_ball_berry`: standard
  error for each fitted parameter, and the p-value for the fit. A dedicated
  plotting function was also added (`plot_ball_berry_fit`).
- A function was added for fitting the Medlyn conductance model (as an
  alternative to the Ball-Berry model): `fit_medlyn`
- Update input argument checks for several functions: `check_required_columns`
  and `set_variable`
- The system for specifying temperature response parameters and calculating
  temperature-dependent values of key photosynthetic parameters has been been
  revamped to make it more flexible and easier to use:
  - `calculate_arrhenius` and `calculate_peaked_gaussian` have been renamed to
    `calculate_temperature_response_arrhenius` and
    `calculate_temperature_response_gaussian` to better reflect their purpose.
  - A new type of temperature response has been added:
    `calculate_temperature_response_johnson`.
  - When calculating C3 assimilation rates or fitting C3 A-Ci curves, `Tp` is
    now specified at 25 degrees C and follows a temperature response function,
    as was already done for `Vcmax`, `J`, and `RL`.
  - When calculating C4 assimilation rates or fitting C4 A-Ci curves, `Jmax` is
    now specified at 25 degrees C, rather than at its optimum value, for
    consistency with the other parameters that can be fit in PhotoGEA.
  - A central function for calculating temperature responses has been added:
    `calculate_temperature_response`. It internally calls the other functions,
    so users can just use this single function.
  - The `c4_arrhenius_von_caemmerer` and `c4_peaked_gaussian_von_caemmerer` have
    been consolidated into a single list suitable for use with
    `calculate_temperature_response`, caled `c4_temperature_param_vc`.
  - The `c3_arrhenius_sharkey` and `c3_arrhenius_bernacchi` lists now include
    Johnson-Eyring-Williams reponses for `Tp` and `gmc` and have been renamed to
    `c3_temperature_param_sharkey` and `c3_temperature_param_bernacchi` since
    they are no longer pure list of Arrhenius parameters.
  - These changes may not be compatible with scripts written for earlier
    versions of PhotoGEA.
- `read_licor_6800_Excel` now checks to make sure the `A` and `gsw` columns are
  not all zero; if these columns are all zero, this indicates that the Excel
  file needs to be "calculated," and a relevant message is sent to the user.
- The C3 assimilation model and C3 A-Ci fits have been updated to include:
  - Another parameter related to TPU (`alpha_t`)
  - Mesophyll conductance (`gmc_at_25`)
- The C4 A-Ci fits have also been updated to include mesophyll conductance
  (`gmc_at_25`) and to fit `J` rather than `Jmax`.
- Revamped the Laisk fitting function:
  - Renamed the function from `calculate_RL_laisk` to `fit_laisk` since a
    fitting procedure is used, and the method also estimates `Ci_star` in
    addition to `RL`.
  - Used the method described in Walker & Ort (2015) and Busch et al. (2024)
  - Added a plotting function for displaying the results of a Laisk fit:
    `plot_laisk_fit`.
- AIC calculations were moved to `residual_stats` so the AIC can be more easily
  calculated for fits from other packages.
- Added a new optimizer (`optimizer_nlminb`) and improved the optimizer
  documentation and testing. The new optimizer is a wrapper for `stats::nlminb`
  and employs a quasi-Newton algorithm.
- Added a new function for identifying limiting processes in C3 curves:
  `identify_c3_limiting_processes`. This function is used internally by
  `fit_c3_aci` and `fit_c3_variable_j`.
- A new option was added to Variable J fits: `check_j`

## Changes in PhotoGEA version 1.0.0 (2024-08-13)

- A new fitting function was added: `fit_c4_aci_hyperbola`. This allows users to
  fit an empirical hyperbola to C4 A-Ci curves, rather than the mechanistic
  model used in `fit_c4_aci`.
  - Several supporting functions were also added:
    `calculate_c4_assimilation_hyperbola`,
    `confidence_intervals_c4_aci_hyperbola`, `error_function_c4_aci_hyperbola`,
    `initial_guess_c4_aci_hyperbola`, and `plot_c4_aci_hyperbola_fit`.
  - Tests were also added for `fit_c4_aci_hyperbola` and
    `calculate_c4_assimilation_hyperbola`
- Added a new control option so users can set or bypass hard constraints on
  parameter values when calculating assimilation rates
  - The input is called `hard_constraints` and it takes a numerical value, where
    higher values impose more constraints on parameter values. The highest value
    is 2.
  - Setting `hard_constraints` to 2 is equivalent to the default behavior in
    previous versions of PhotoGEA.
  - The default value in all functions that take it as an input is 0, which
    imposes no hard constraints.
  - It has been added to `calculate_c3_assimilation`, `calculate_c3_variable_j`,
    `calculate_c4_assimilation`, and `calculate_c4_assimilation_hyperbola`, as
    well as any functions that use these internally, such as
    `calculate_c3_limitations_warren` and `fit_c3_aci`.
- The default bounds for all the curve fitting functions have been expanded to
  avoid biasing the results.
- Confidence limits for parameters at leaf temperature have been added.
- Options for identifying and removing unreliable parameter estimates have been
  added. With this change, the `remove_unreliable_param` input argument must now
  be a numeric value rather than a logical value.
  - A value of 0 disables this feature (equivalent to `FALSE` in previous
    versions of PhotoGEA).
  - A value of 1 removes parameters (and their corresponding rates) if the
    corresponding rate is never the smallest rate.
  - A value of 2 removes parameters (and their corresponding rates) if the
    corresponding rate is never the smallest rate, and removes parameters if the
    the upper confidence limit is infinity (equivalent to `TRUE` in previous
    versions of PhotoGEA).
  - The default value for all functions that have this option is 2.
- A warning was removed from `fit_c4_aci`, which had previously suggested to
  avoid fitting more than one of `Vcmax_at_25`, `Vpr`, and `Jmax_at_opt`.
- The default value of the `require_positive_gmc` input argument of the
  `fit_c3_variable_j` function has been changed to `positive_a`.
- The names of respiration rates were changed: `Rd` (the rate of day
  respiration) has been changed to `RL` (the rate of respiration in the light)
  and `Rm` (the rate of day respiration occurring in the mesophyll) has been
  changed to `RLm` (the rate of respiration in the light occurring in the
  mesophyll). The subscript `L` for "light" is more clear than `d` for "day,"
  since in some contexts `d` refers to "dark." One function name was modified
  during this process: `calculate_rd_laisk` became `calculate_RL_laisk`.
- The `basic_stats` function was updated so it can ignore `NA` values when
  calculating averages and standard errors.
- The `check_response_curve_data` function was updated so there is now an option
  to create a warning rather than an error message when a problem is detected.
- The `estimate_operating_point` function was updated so a value of `NA` for the
  `Ca_atmospheric` input simply bypasses the operating point calculations. Along
  with this, the default value for `Ca_atmospheric` was set to `NA` in the
  `fit_c3_aci`, `fit_c3_variable_j`, and `fit_c4_aci` functions. With these
  changes, calculating the operating point is now optional.
- The C3 and C4 A-Ci vignettes were updated to remove some outdated information
  and to take advantage of the new fitting function `fit_c4_aci_hyperbola`.
- Increased minimum required R version from `3.6.0` to `4.0.0`. The GitHub
  actions testing setup no longer works for R < 4.0, so it has become too
  difficult to guarantee compatability with an earlier version.

## Changes in PhotoGEA version 0.12.0 (2024-06-03)

- Changed fitting method from least-squares to maximum likelihood in
  `fit_c3_aci`, `fit_c3_variable_j`, and `fit_c4_aci`.
  - We use a normal distribution for calculating the likelihood.
  - Best-fit parameter values are determined with `sigma = 1`.
  - Then the true value of the likelihood can be estimated using `sigma = RMSE`.
  - Confidence intervals are also calculated using `sigma = RMSE`.
  - Fitting functions include the Akaike information criterion (AIC) in their
    outputs
  - Default settings have been changed to always calculate confidence intervals
    and remove unreliable parameter estimates, to use a more reliable (but
    slower) optimizer, and to fit `alpha_old` (for C3 A-Ci and Variable J fits);
    these settings will ensure more robust fitting results
- Changed the C3 assimilation and Variable J equations to accommodate the new
  alpha parameters from Busch et al. (2018)
  - There are now three separate parameters: `alpha_old` (previously `alpha_g`),
    `alpha_g`, and `alpha_s`
  - If `alpha_old` is nonzero, then `alpha_g` and `alpha_s` must be zero.
    Likewise, if `alpha_g` or `alpha_s` is nonzero, then `alpha_old` must be
    zero. This will prevent users from mixing the two models together.
- The fitting functions `fit_c3_aci`, `fit_c3_variable_j`, and `fit_c4_aci` now
  include a new output called `fits_interpolated` that contains values of the
  predicted assimilation rates with a `Ci` step of 1 ppm.
- New plotting functions have been added: `plot_c3_aci_fit` and
  `plot_c4_aci_fit`. These functions use the new information in
  `fits_interpolated` to make nice plots comparing the measured data and the
  fits.
- Now users can optionally ignore `NA` values when using `xyplot_avg_rc` and
  `barchart_with_errorbars`
- Changed `exclude_outliers` to make sure it doesn't exclude `NA` values
- Specialized functions for writing `exdf` objects to `CSV` files and recreating
  `exdf` objects from those files are now available: `write.csv.exdf` and
  `read.csv.exdf`.
- When determining the degree of trust in a best-fit parameter value, we now
  consider parameters with an upper confidence limit of `Inf` to be unreliable.
- Light- and electron-limited assimilation has been added to
  `calculate_c4_assimilation`; now we have fully implemented the von Caemmerer
  model equations. This also necessitated a new function for temperature
  response calculations: `calculate_peaked_gaussian`.
- New fitting parameters have been added to `fit_c4_aci`: `alpha_psii`, `gbs`,
  `Jmax_at_opt` and `Rm_frac`.
- It is now possible to remove unreliable parameter estimates when using
  `fit_c4_aci`.
- Tests have been updated to make sure the fitting functions can gracefully
  handle a fit failure, even when estimating confidence intervals and/or
  removing unreliable parameter estimates.
- Added a new optimizer (`optimizer_hjkb`) and changed their default arguments
  so a user must always specify the tolerance or number of generations.
- All functions that require an O2 partial pressure now calculate it from the
  total pressure and the oxygen concentration (expressed as a percentage).
- A new option has been added to `read_licor_6800_Excel` and
  `read_licor_6800_plaintext`: `get_oxygen`. When this input is `TRUE`,
  `get_oxygen_from_preamble` will automatically be used to get the oxygen
  percentage from the file's preamble when it is loaded.
- A new option has been added to `read_gasex_file`: `standardize_columns`.
- `read_licor_6800_plaintext` can now read log files that were closed and
  reopened
- Added a new function called `PhotoGEA_example_file_path` to avoid using
  `system.file` in examples since `system.path` has been confusing for some
  users
- `check_licor_data` has been renamed to `check_response_curve_data` since it is
  not limited to only Licor measurements
- Specified a minimum supported R version: `3.6.0`.

## Changes in PhotoGEA version 0.11.0 (2024-02-12)

- Added new options for adding penalties to the error function during Variable J
  fits, that enable the user to selectively penalize negative or unreasonably
  large values of mesophyll conductance.
- Made a few improvements to C3 curve fitting functions (`fit_c3_aci` and
  `fit_c3_variable_j`):
  - Two more parameters can now be fit: `alpha` (related to TPU) and
    `Gamma_star`.
  - Unreliable parameter estimates can now be excluded; for example, if no
    points on a curve have An = Ap, the fit will return NA for TPU.
  - The initial guess functions (`initial_guess_c3_aci` and
    `initial_guess_c3_variable_j`) can now accommodate user-supplied values of
    `alpha`.
- Made a few improvements to all three nonlinear fitting functions
  (`fit_c3_aci`, `fit_c3_variable_j`, and `fit_c4_aci`):
  - The error functions are now available in the package namespace as
    `error_function_c3_aci`, `error_function_c3_variable_j`, and
    `error_function_c4_aci`.
  - Confidence intervals around the best-fit values can now be calculated
    automatically by the fitting functions, or manually using three new
    functions in the package namespace:
    `confidence_intervals_c3_aci`, `confidence_intervals_c3_variable_j`, and
    `confidence_intervals_c4_aci`.
  - The initial guess functions are now created internally instead of being an
    input argument.
  - There is a new system for supplying fit options (upper and lower bounds, and
    which parameters to fit):
    - Users now only need to specify changes from the default settings.
    - The order of parameters no longer matters because lists of named elements
      are used.
    - Parameters that could be fit, but are not being fit, can either be set to
      fixed values or to values from a column of an exdf object.
    - Unknown parameters are now provided in alphabetical order when applicable
      (such as the first input arguments to `calculate_c3_assimilation`).
  - The functions are more tolerant to curves with severe problems (such as
    negative Ci) that prevent a good fit from being found; rather than throwing
    an error, the fit functions now silently return `NA` for all results, along
    with a message explaining the issue.
- Added a function for estimating `Rd` with the Laisk method:
  `calculate_rd_laisk`
- A "unit dictionary" was added for internal use; this may be expanded and used
  more often in the future.
- Renamed several variables and input arguments:
  - Licor files contain a column called `alpha`, and several different "alphas"
    were used throughout `PhotoGEA`. To avoid confusion, the values in
    `PhotoGEA` were renamed as follows:
    - `alpha_g`: used in C3 assimilation calculations
    - `alpha_pr`: used in Gamma_star calculations
    - `alpha_psii`: used in C4 assimilation calculations
  - The acronym "TPU" was used to refer to a process (triose phosphate
    utilization) and the maximum rate of that process. To avoid confusion, the
    rate parameter was renamed to `Tp`
- Tests were added for several functions:
  - `calculate_c3_assimilation`
  - `fit_c3_aci`
  - `fit_c3_variable_j`
  - `fit_c4_aci`
  - `calculate_c3_limitations_grassi`
  - `calculate_c3_limitations_warren`
- The `read_gasex_file` function now automatically includes the filename as a
  column in the resulting `exdf` object; this helps with troubleshooting
  problematic curves or files.

## Changes in PhotoGEA version 0.10.0 (2023-12-16)

- Reorganized the variable J fitting functions to be more like `fit_c3_aci`:
  - Added `calculate_c3_variable_j`, `initial_guess_c3_variable_j`, and
    `fit_c3_variable_j`.
  - Removed `dpmn_error_jrv`, `dpmn_error_jrvtt`, `dpmn_error_jrv_tau`,
    `dpmn_error_jrv_tpu`, and `photosynthesis_TRF`.
- Added a new optimizer from the `DEoptim` package (called `optimizer_deoptim`)
  and renamed `default_optimizer` to `optimizer_nmkb`. The new
  `optimizer_deoptim` is used as the default optimizer for variable J fitting.
- Added two new functions for calculating the relative limiting factors of C3
  photosynthesis: `calculate_c3_limitations_grassi` and
  `calculate_c3_limitations_warren`.
- Added a new function for estimating the operating point from a measured A-Ci
  curve: `estimate_operating_point`.
- Added two new color specifications (`multi_curve_line_colors` and
  `multi_curve_point_colors`) and used them in vignette examples.
- `fit_c3_aci` and `fit_c4_aci` now use `estimate_operating_point` to
  automatically estimate the operating point and include it with the other fit
  parameters.
- The C3 and C4 A-Ci vignettes now show include the operating point in one of
  the figures.
- Renamed `calculate_iwue` to `calculate_wue` and provided documentation for
  this function, which now calculates two measures of leaf-level water use
  efficiency.
- Provided documentation for `factorize_id_column` and converted it to an S3
  method so it can be applied to data frames and exdf objects.
- Removed the `process_id_column` function since it can easily be replicated
  using `paste`.
- Stopped reversing colors in `xyplot_avg_rc`.
- Fixed a typo in `calculate_c3_assimilation` where `Rd` (the value of day
  respiration at 25 degrees C) was used in place of `Rd_tl` (the value of day
  respiration at the leaf temperature) when calculating net assimilation rates.
- Added some developer documentation, an `R CMD check` GitHub workflow, and a
  code coverage GitHub workflow.

## Changes in PhotoGEA version 0.9.0 (2023-10-25)

- Added a new convenience function for printing plot objects: `pdf_print`
- Added and/or documented several functions related to isotope discrimination
  measurements:
  - `calculate_gamma_star`
  - `calculate_gm_busch`
  - `calculate_gm_ubierna`
  - `calculate_isotope_discrimination`
  - `calculate_leakiness_ubierna`
  - `calculate_ternary_correction`
  - `get_oxygen_from_preamble`
  - `get_sample_valve_from_filename`
  - `pair_gasex_and_tdl`
- Added two new example data files (`licor_for_gm_site11.xslx` and
  `tdl_for_gm.dat`) for use in examples and vignettes.
- Renamed some variables related to isotope measurements; the new terms are
  more consistent with the way these quantities are typically described:
  - `total_isotope_ratio` was renamed to `delta_13C`
  - `total_mixing_ratio` was renamed to `total_CO2`
- Removed a function that was specific to one user
  (`batch_get_genotype_info_from_licor_filename`).
- Added a new R file (`constants.R`) to store the values of some constants that
  appear in multiple functions; this will help ensure that consistent values
  are used in each instance.
- Improved some error handling in `read_gasex_file` and attempted to clarify
  instructions for selecting files to load.
- Added two basic tests of `read_gasex_file` using the `testthat` package.

## Changes in PhotoGEA version 0.8.0 (2023-04-30)

- Modified `identify_tdl_cycles` and `process_tdl_cycle_polynomial` so they can
  handle cycles where there are multiple measurement logs from each valve.
- Added several functions for calculating quadratic roots; these are not
  exported in the package namespace, but are now used in
  `calculate_c3_assimilation` and `calculate_c4_assimilation` to make the code
  cleaner and more robust.
- Other updates to `calculate_c3_assimilation`:
  - Choose a minimal RuBP carboxylation rate rather than a minimal net CO2
    assimilation rate.
  - Allow the user to specify a value of `alpha` (previously this value was
    hard-coded to 0).
  - Allow the user to specify two separate curvature values when including
    co-limitation.
  - Renamed `min_aj_cutoff` and `max_aj_cutoff` to `cj_crossover_min` and
    `cj_crossover_max` to better reflect their purpose.

## Changes in PhotoGEA version 0.7.1 (2023-01-11)

- Added new outputs from `fit_c3_aci` and `fit_c4_aci` that include the average
  values of leaf-temperature-dependent parameters like `Vcmax` and `Rd`.
- Added options for specifying a flat temperature response when fitting C3 or C4
  A-Ci curves; these are available via the two new data sets
  `c3_arrhenius_no_temp` and `c4_arrhenius_no_temp`.

  - https://github.com/eloch216/PhotoGEA/pull/65

## Changes in PhotoGEA version 0.7.0 (2022-12-19)

- Added new example files:
  - `plaintext_licor_file` represents a plaintext Licor LI-6800 log file.
  - `c4_aci_1.xlsx` and `c4_aci_2.xlsx` contain examples of C4 A-Ci curves
    measured with Licor LI-6800 instruments.
- Made several significant changes to functions that read data from log files:
  - Added the ability to read plaintext Licor LI-6800 log files.
  - Consolidated all file-reading functions into a single one called
    `read_gasex_file`.
  - Depending on user-supplied inputs that specify the instrument and file type,
    `read_gasex_file` internally calls either `read_licor_6800_Excel`,
    `read_licor_6800_plaintext`, or `read_CR3000` to actually read the data from
    the file.
  - When loading LI-6800 Excel log files, it is no longer necessary to provide
    information about the preamble and data rows.
  - The previous reading functions `read_licor_file` and `read_tdl_file` are now
    deprecated. Since these functions are commonly used in scripts, a message
    will be sent to any users who attempt to call these functions. Eventually
    they will be completely removed from the package namespace.
- Made significant changes to the way pressure values are handled:
  - Added a new function that calculates the total pressure inside a Licor
    chamber from the separate values of ambient pressure and the chamber
    overpressure: `calculate_total_pressure`.
  - Modified several other functions to just expect a value of total pressure
    rather than separate values of ambient pressure and chamber overpressure,
    since this system for storing pressure values is just an artifact of Licor
    log files:
    - `apply_gm`
    - `calculate_c3_assimilation`
    - `calculate_gas_properties`
    - `fit_c3_aci`
- Renamed or modified several other functions:
  - `calculate_cc` is now `apply_gm` so it can be used for C3 and C4
    photosynthesis calculations.
  - `apply_gm` was modified to include partial pressures in its outputs.
  - `fit_c4_aci` was modified to make it more like `fit_c3_aci`.
  - Added a new input argument to `xyplot_avg_rc` so that y-axis error bars can
    be disabled.
  - Added a new input argument to `apply_gm` so that drawdown calculations are
    now optional.
  - Improved some of the error messages generated by `check_licor_data`.
  - Included ATP and NADPH usage in the C3 assimilation calculations.
- Added several other new functions:
  - `initial_guess_c4_aci` makes initial guesses for C4 photosynthetic
    parameters.
  - `calculate_c4_assimilation` calculates assimilation values using S. von
    Caemmerer's model for C4 photosynthesis.
- Added a new vignette demonstrating how to analyze C4 A-Ci curve data.

  - https://github.com/eloch216/PhotoGEA/pull/62

## Changes in PhotoGEA version 0.6.1 (2022-11-01)

- Modified `fit_c3_aci` so it now ensures that the initial guess lies within
  (and not on) the bounds. This is a requirement for the `dfoptim::nmkb` solver
  and presumably other bounded optimizers as well.
- PRs related to creating this version:
  - https://github.com/eloch216/PhotoGEA/pull/57

## Changes in PhotoGEA version 0.6.0 (2022-10-06)

- Moved the `dfoptim` package from `Suggests` to `Imports` because it is used by
  an essential part of `PhotoGEA`.
- The `check_required_variables` function was moved to the package namespace.
- Added and/or documented several functions:
  - A default optimizer function (`default_optimizer`).
  - A function for guessing for C3 parameter values (`initial_guess_c3_aci`).
  - A function for identifying columns that take a single unique value
    (`identifier_columns`).
  - A function that calculates error metrics from the values of residuals,
    including the root mean squared error (RMSE) and several others
    (`residual_stats`).
- Small changes were made to several functions:
  - `cbind.exdf` no longer requires all objects to have the same number of rows.
  - `[<-.exdf` now allows users to remove columns by setting their values to
    `NULL`.
  - The conversion of the timestamp column to `POSIXlt` in `read_tdl_file` and
    `read_licor_file` can now be skipped by setting `timestamp_colname` to `NA`.
- Significant changes have been made to `fit_c3_aci`:
  - It now has an option to set a `curvature` value that can be used to allow
    co-limitation of the net assimilation rate.
  - It now uses `initial_guess_c3_aci` to generate initial guesses by default.
  - It now has an option to fix certain parameter values (such as `TPU`) and
    exclude them from the fitting process via a new input argument called
    `fixed`.
  - Its output now includes residuals and error metrics such as the RMSE.
- `fit_ball_berry` also returns residuals and error metrics in its output.
- Two new vignettes were added:
  - "Creating Your Own Processing Tools" discusses the best practices for
    writing custom functions for processing. As an example, a function for
    fitting a rectangular hyperbola to an A-Ci curve is developed.
  - "Combining PhotoGEA With Other Packages" discusses best practices for
    writing wrappers for processing tools from other packages. As an example, a
    wrapper for `plantecophys::fitaci` is developed.
- Several other vignettes were modified:
  - The "Analyzing C3 A-Ci Curves" vignette has been updated to include the new
    features of `fit_c3_aci`.
  - The "Developing a Data Analysis Pipeline" vignette has been updated to
    include the new functions added in this version.
  - The "Working With Extended Data Frames" vignette has been updated to include
    some new diagrams.
  - The "Getting Started With PhotoGEA" vignette has been updated to include
    links to the new vignettes.

## Changes in PhotoGEA version 0.5.0 (2022-09-16)

- Added a new vignette demonstrating how to analyze C3 A-Ci curve data.
- Included `TPU` in the output from `calculate_c3_assimilation`.
- In the `organize_response_curve_data` function, changed the default value of
  the `ordering_column_tolerance` column to `Inf` to disable this check by
  default, since we often want to reorder using a column like `Ci` that does not
  follow the same sequence of values in every curve.
- Added new input arguments to `fit_c3_aci`: `min_aj_cutoff` and
  `max_aj_cutoff`, which provide a way to constrain the range of `Cc` where `Aj`
  is allowed to be the limiting assimilation rate.
- Added new function for calibrating TDL data (`process_tdl_cycle_polynomial`)
  and an option for using it in the `gm_from_tdl` script.
- Modified Licor-TDL pairing to stop assuming a particular relationship between
  the sample and reference valve numbers.
- Fixed an issue with `calculate_c3_assimilation` that was causing it to report
  incorrect `An` values at low `Cc`.
- Fixed several typos where `Ac` was misidentified as the "RuBP-limited" rate;
  in fact, it is the RuBP-saturated rate but is more commonly referred to as the
  rubisco-limited rate.
- Added a new example script that uses `fit_c3_aci`.

## Changes in PhotoGEA version 0.4.0 (2022-09-07)

- Made several improvements to accessibility:
  - Renamed GitHub repository from `licor-processing-and-analysis` to
    `PhotoGEA`.
  - Made GitHub repository public, which allows for a simpler installation via
    `remotes::install_github`.
  - Initialized website using `pkgdown` and GitHub Pages by using
    `usethis::use_pkgdown_github_pages`; website is now available at
    [https://eloch216.github.io/PhotoGEA/index.html](https://eloch216.github.io/PhotoGEA/index.html).
- Made minor improvements to the Ball-Berry vignette:

  - A function for calculating Arrhenius exponents (`calculate_arrhenius`).
- Modified the behavior of several functions:
  - Added an option for a more thorough check in `is.exdf`.
  - `organize_response_curve_data` now has a specification for points to remove
    rather than points to keep, because this is usually easier to do.
- Added documentation for several code objects:
  - `document_variables` (formerly `specify_variables`)
  - `exclude_outliers`
  - `barchart_with_errorbars` (formerly `bar_wrapper`)

  - `multi_curve_colors` (formerly `default_colors`)
  - `calculate_cc`
  - `check_required_variables` (formerly `check_required_columns`)
  - `example_data_files` (and also added new files for C3 A-Ci curves)
  - `c3_arrhenius_bernacchi`, `c3_arrhenius_sharkey`, and
    `c4_arrhenius_von_caemmerer`
- Removed several limited-use functions from the package namespace:
  - `add_gm_to_licor_data_from_table`
  - `add_gm_to_licor_data_from_value`
  - `batch_specify_oxygen`
  - `batch_specify_respiration`
  - `choose_input_gm_table_file`

  - A vignette describing how to develop a data analysis pipeline.
  - A vignette introducing new users to PhotoGEA.
- Started supplying default column names in several functions to make code
  shorter:
  - `fit_c3_aci`
  - `calculate_c3_assimilation`
  - `calculate_cc`
  - `calculate_gas_properties`
  - `calculate_c3_assimilation`
  - `calculate_ball_berry_index`
  - `fit_ball_berry`

## Changes in PhotoGEA version 0.3.0 (2022-08-15)

- This version adds a substantial amount of documentation, including a vignette
  describing how to use PhotoGEA to analyze TDL data.
- While working on documentation, several changes were made to key functions so
  they behaved more reasonably and became easier to document.
- Changes to functions and their documentation includes:
  - `exdf` objects can now be initialized from just a data frame; in this case,
    units and categories will all be `NA`.
  - `apply_fit_across_reps` and `process_tdl_cycles` have been replaced by two
    new lower-level functions that offer more generality: `by.exdf` and
    `consolidate`.
  - `check_response_curve_data` and `check_signal_averaging_data` have been
    consolidated into one function: `check_licor_data`.
  - An `exdf` method for `cbind` has been added.
  - `exclude_tdl_cycles` and `extract_tdl_valve` have been removed since they
    can easily be reproduced with more basic exdf functionality.
  - All functions for creating or modifying Excel files have been removed since
    we no longer want to follow this strategy.
- `basic_stats` and the "Variable J" example script have been fixed.

## Changes in PhotoGEA version 0.2.0 (2022-07-26)

- This version adds a substantial amount of documentation, including a vignette
  describing how to use PhotoGEA to analyze Ball-Berry data.
- While working on documentation, several changes were made to key functions so
  they behaved more reasonably and became easier to document.
- At the moment, `basic_stats` and the "Variable J" example script have been
  broken.

## Changes in PhotoGEA version 0.1.0

- This is the first version of PhotoGEA. At this point, the package is in a
  state of rapid development, and not all changes will be described here.
- We are reserving version `1.0.0` for the first version where all R package
  functions and data sets have been documented; until then, major changes should
  only increase the minor version number.
